## YTP+ Classic is a rehash of [YTP+](https://github.com/philosophofee/YTPPlus)
### It does not include new changes as of yet.

## What is YTP+ Classic?
YTP+ is the name given to a set of tools to automatically generate machinima-like videos, while YTP+ Classic is a rehash of the [original software created by Ben Brown](https://github.com/philosophofee/YTPPlusUI) that replaces dead links.

## How do I configure YTP+ Classic?
All configuration settings may be found in the application itself, either on the interface or in the Tools menu.

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is required for the software to run.

[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) is required for the Squidward effect but is otherwise not needed.

## I installed ImageMagick, but Squidward still doesn't work?
Try adding magick.exe to your system path. If you've checked the box needed in the installation prompt for ImageMagick, try restarting your computer. If all else fails, try setting magick.exe manually via the program.

## I got a great idea for the program, where to start?
Anyone is welcome to submit a pull request or suggest ideas via the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bzhzRmg).

## The YTP+ Project
The [YTP+ project](https://ytp-plus.github.io/) is an ongoing effort to automatically generate machinimas. Anyone can contribute by forking a YTP+ related repository and expanding upon the goal. This software is apart of the project as well.
